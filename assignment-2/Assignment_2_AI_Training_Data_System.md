## Purpose
This document outlines the functional and system requirements for the AI developer's project, focusing on improving the categorization and balance of training data.

## Scenario
The client is an AI developer who is using the publicly available data for AI training through web scraping. After several discussions, the key challenges identified are:
- Developers require categorized training questions separated from answers for better self-affirmation.
- Developers need balanced training data to prevent biases in AI models.

## 1. Requirements
*What the system must do to meet the user needs.*

1. **Categorized Training Questions**
	- **Requirement:** The system shall allow the developers to store the questions and answers in the distinct, labeled of the datasets.
	- **Justification:** Separating the questions from the answers which will help to enables developers to review and validate them independently, supporting self-affirmation during the AI training model.	
	- **Example:** A question can be asked like "What is the reinforcement learning?" which is tagged under the "Machine Learning branch," while its answer is stored in a separate "Answers" repository/branch.

2. **Balanced Training Data**
	- **Requirement:** The system shall analyze the datasets for the biases and generate balance reports accordingly.
	- **Justification:** Balanced data improves the AI model fairness and it's accuracy by avoiding overrepresentation of any specific groups or the topics.
	- **Example:** A report showing that the 80% of the healthcare-related data focuses on "pediatrics," which is flagging it as a potential imbalance.

3.  **Data Verification and Modification**
	- **Requirement:** The system shall provide a user interface where developers can verify and modify training data categorization.
	- **Justification:** Ensures accuracy and flexibility in training data management.
	- **Example:** A review panel that allows manual adjustments to categorized data before finalization.

4. **Data Format Support**
	- **Requirement:** The system shall enable exporting categorized data in multiple formats (e.g., JSON, CSV).
	- **Justification:** Different AI training tools require varied input formats for compatibility.
	- **Example:** A feature that allows developers to download structured training data in user-specified formats.

### **System Requirements**
*Technical specifications to support functionality.*

1. **Web Scraping Integration**
	- **Requirement:** The system must scrape all the data from the multiple public websites and domain that we can use for the configurable tools.
	- **Justification:** Flexibility in the data collection which will ensures the diverse and relevant training datasets for the AI model.	
	- **Example:** Integration with the **Scrapy** to extract Q&A pairs from forums like Stack Overflow and other website.

2. **Bias Detection Module**
	- **Requirement:** The system shall compute bias metrics (e.g., demographic, topic distribution) within 10 minutes of data ingestion.
	- **Justification:** Rapid analysis that allows the developers to iterate quickly on all the dataset adjustments.
	- **Example:** A Python-based module with using **Pandas** and **NumPy** to calculate statistical distributions for the Bias module.

3. **API Integration**
	- **Requirement:** The system shall provide an API for integrating with other AI training tools.
	- **Justification:** API support enables seamless interoperability with external AI development platforms.
	- **Example:** A RESTful API that allows querying and retrieving categorized training data.

4. **Security and Access Control**
	- **Requirement:** The system shall provide access control mechanisms to ensure data security and integrity.
	- **Justification:** Prevents unauthorized modifications and data breaches.
	- **Example:** Role-based access control (RBAC) limiting editing privileges to authorized users.

## 2. Assumptions & Validation
### **Assumptions**

1. The client has access to all the publicly available data that complies with ethical and legal regulations.
2. Bias detection can be improved using existing open-source AI fairness tools.
3. Developers require a UI/UX interface for categorization and validation.
4. The AI developer's primary focus is on improving training data quality rather than model tuning.
5. The clientâ€™s team has expertise in using cloud storage solutions.

### **Validation Plan**
1. Regular feedback sessions with the client to confirm requirement alignment.
2. Prototype demonstrations to validate user interactions.
3. Testing against real-world datasets to ensure bias detection accuracy.
4. Performance benchmarks to confirm system scalability and efficiency.
5. Review a sample of 500 scraped entries with the client to confirm accurate Q&A separation.
6. Demonstrate scraping from 3+ websites (e.g., Reddit, Wikipedia) during a client demo.
