## AI Training Data Categorization

### Description
The AI training data must be categorized with separate sections for questions and answers. This ensures developers can work on self-affirmation tasks without confusion.

### Acceptance Criteria
- Questions are stored in a separate file/table from answers.
- Data format follows a predefined structure (e.g., JSON, CSV, SQL).
- There is a script available to organize unstructured data.

### Assumptions
- The data to be categorized is available and accessible.
- Developers have the necessary tools and permissions to access and modify the data.
- The predefined structure for data format is agreed upon and documented.

### Validation Plan
1. **Data Separation Check**: Verify that questions and answers are stored in separate files/tables.
2. **Format Compliance**: Ensure the data format adheres to the predefined structure (e.g., JSON, CSV, SQL).
3. **Script Functionality**: Test the script to confirm it correctly organizes unstructured data into the required format.

### Tasks
1. **Define Data Structure**:
   - Document the predefined structure for storing questions and answers.
   - Review and approve the structure with the team.

2. **Develop Separation Script**:
   - Write a script to separate questions and answers from unstructured data.
   - Test the script with sample data to ensure accuracy.

3. **Data Migration**:
   - Migrate existing data into the new structure.
   - Validate the migrated data to ensure it meets the acceptance criteria.

4. **Review and Validation**:
   - Conduct a peer review of the data separation and migration process.
   - Perform validation checks as outlined in the Validation Plan.
