#1. Purpose
This document is a blue print which I have prepared for the initial client meeting with the Pet Datcare Business. The sole goal is to identify the key points and breakdown the requirments to ensure an effective software development process.

#2. Business Objective
The primary objective for the docuument is to mention what are the needs i.e. to streamline the onboarding process for the employees and the client with reducing inefficiency and improving the customer satisfication. This will help us to achived by adding the digital automation, standardized workflow and enhancing the communication methods.

#3. Scenarios
After conducting the interviews/pre-sales meeting with the stakeholders the following bottleneck/issues were identified:
1. Owners frustration: Onboarding flow is a headace for them as it takes in total atleast 3 months to complete it which is so long.
2. Employees frustrations: The onboarding process for new clients is inconsistent among all the employees.
3. Customers frustrations: The onboarding process is difficult to follow as well is it's not that simple and it's hard to fill out all the things with multiple information.
